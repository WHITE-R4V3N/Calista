Can look into adding a MCP for the AI to interact with applications such as ghidra, or even interacting with the website interface.
This will have to be very custom and incorperating it within the AI itself will take some work. However the trade off is being able to
add modules for specific tasks or connections to the MCP for specific application we want the AI to interact with.

Also look into adding multiprocessing to make the model train a little faster.
