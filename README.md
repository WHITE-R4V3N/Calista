<!-- About the project -->
## About The Project

This has been a personal project started back in May 2024. It origianlly started as a side project into learning how to create an AI neural network. During this time I was very into Capture The Flag (Cyber) competitions and found I did not have enough time to complete the harder questions. This was due to focusing on the easier challenges that were simple as reading text or parsing logs to find specific data.

I took my side project and research into creating a neural network from scratch and combined it with my program at SAIT. Using CTF's challenges as a measurement as to how effective the AI would be able to perform tasks.

I have spent over a year performing research and working hard on creating this project. Calista is no where near complete and I plan to work on Calista during my spare time now that I am done my course.

<!-- Getting Started -->
## Getting Started
This project is a python based project and will require some installation of libraries and possibly python itself. You can try running the program and it will tell you what needs to be installed.

### Prerequisites

This project uses Python 3.0+ and Python needs to be installed before running the program.
